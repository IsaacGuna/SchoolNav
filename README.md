# SchoolNav

Have you ever found yourself at a job interview, a hospital appointment, or even your first day at school lost!? 

If yes, hope you can relate its not a nice feeling. Imagine the world without the technology of digital maps and algorithmic path finding, sorry for the headache there...

The sad fact is we left out those long and wide buildings that stretch across houses and even roads. That's the void SchoolNav fills!

SchoolNav is a route finding application (like google maps) that can find the shortest path to go from one **room** to another in your maze of a building. 

This is my NEA project, my A-Level coding project for Computer Science. Everything runs smoothly, offline, locally with clean animation. The catch? It currently works with just one school.

Spending 6 months on it: 
 - Implemented Login System with Account Management
 - Utilisation of Google Maps Satellite Imagery
 - Included clean UI/UX (debatable)
 - Processed a list of all search locations
 - Functioned a route finder using GPS to find starting point
 - Magpied Waze's Report Feature e.g. "Exams in Rm23"

Future Improvements: 
 - Add adaptability to adjust to different buildings
 - Work with routes including different floors/levels
 - ... Plenty more...

It was a joy conceiving and creating this!
